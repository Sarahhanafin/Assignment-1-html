        <h1>Research Journey</h1>
        <hr/>
        <p>Before we could start think about designing the web app, we had to think about the user. In this case the users 
           were the sales people and the people in the office (the Admin). To try and understand them we created Personas, 
           User stories, Empathy maps, and then once we had done that we brainstormed features that our web app coupld 
           possibly have for both the sales and admin to help both.

                    their needs, goals, and challenges. It allows us to design solutions, such as tools or workflows, 
                    that are tailored to their specific role and responsibilities. A persona also ensures that we keep 
                    the user at the center of decision-making, making sure that any system we develop actually
                     supports their work and make their day-to-day tasks easier. It gives a clear picture of who they are 
                     and what they value, fostering more effective communication and collaboration.</p>

                    client relationships. By defining a clear persona, we can focus on making their work easier, more 
                    efficient, and more impactful. It also helps us empathize with their role, making sure we provide

                      A user story keeps the focus on creating solutions that support their role, ensuring

                     are practical, user-friendly, and directly aligned with their daily workflow. It ensures we're
